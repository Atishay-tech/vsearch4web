A webapp using Flask.

I am presently learning Python from O'Reilly's "Head first Python" and this is the first time I have worked with Flask.
Most of the code is same to the book and I haven't done anything new. I am just learning how webapps work.
This webapp checks if given letters are present in the words given by user.

# What I Learned:
- Creating a web appliction in Python using Flask.
- Using HTML with Python using Jinja2 template engine.
- Saving the web requests from user on a file.
- Using databse( MySQL) to store and retrieve data in place of files.
- Deploying and hosing my webapp on the cloud, PythonAnywhere.
- Creating my own distribution packages and using them in other files.
